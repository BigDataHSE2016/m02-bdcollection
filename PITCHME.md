Smart Devices -> Internet of Things

#HSLIDE
# Some facts
- 2016: 6-15 billion devices
- 2020: 50 billion devices
- the potential economic impact of IoT by 2025: $2.7-6.2 trillion

#HSLIDE
## Security and Privacy
- **Security** - protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide
- **Privacy** - the quality or state of being apart from company or observation; freedom from unauthorized intrusion

#HSLIDE
# Why is it important?
- impact on the physical objects
- smart devices are everywhere: human bodies, vehicles, houses
- enterprise risks: spying and direct harm

#HSLIDE
**3 domains of IoT Security**

#HSLIDE
**IoT Fog Domain**
- Location
- Mobility
- Lower Computing Capacity

#HSLIDE
**IoT Cloud Domain**

#HSLIDE
**Main IoT security challenges**
- Multiple Technologies
- Multiple Verticals
- Scalability
- Big Data
- Resource Limitations
- Remote Locations
- Mobility
- Delay-Sensitive Service

#HSLIDE
**IoT Privacy: general tactics**
- Data minimization
- Encryption
- Transparency
- Anonymization/pseudonymization/de-identification

#HSLIDE
**IoT Privacy: specific challenges tactics**
- Conduct a privacy and/or security risk assessment.
- Test security measures before launching products.
- Incorporate the use of smart defaults
- Implement reasonable access control measures
- Inform consumers about the “shelf-life” of products
- Impose reasonable limits on the collection and retention of consumer data (in other words, data minimization)
- De-identifying stored consumer data
- Continue to implement Notice and Choice
